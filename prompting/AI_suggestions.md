Hello! I want to create an application. Its specification is in the @specification.md file. Please have a look at that file and suggest me improvements to the specification.

I've reviewed your garden planting designer specification, and it's a well-thought-out concept! Here are my suggestions for improvements to make the specification more complete and implementation-ready:

1. User Interface and Navigation
Add details about the main navigation structure and how users move between different views (map, timeline, settings)
Specify whether this is a web application, desktop app, or mobile app
Consider adding a dashboard/overview page showing garden status at a glance
2. Enhanced Plant Management
Add more plant properties:
Growth duration (how many weeks from planting to harvest)
Spacing requirements (how much space each plant needs)
Companion planting benefits (not just compatibility)
Seasonal preferences (spring/summer/fall crops)
Plant family/category for crop rotation planning
3. Smart Planning Features
Conflict Detection: Automatically highlight when:
Plants are placed too close to incompatible plants
Overlapping timeframes in the same slot
Plants with conflicting water/sun needs are adjacent
Suggestions Engine: Recommend optimal plant placements based on:
Available space and timing
Companion planting rules
Crop rotation principles
Succession planting opportunities
4. Enhanced Timeline Functionality
Add week numbers/dates for better temporal reference
Include planting and harvesting indicators
Show transition periods between crops
Add seasonal markers (frost dates, growing seasons)
5. Data Management
Specify the complete JSON schema structure
Add import/export capabilities for plant databases
Include backup and versioning of garden plans
Consider template gardens for common setups
6. User Experience Improvements
Drag and Drop: Allow dragging plants between slots and time periods
Copy/Paste: Duplicate successful planting patterns
Undo/Redo: Essential for complex planning sessions
Search and Filter: Find plants by properties or compatibility
7. Validation and Constraints
Define maximum plants per slot based on plant size
Specify minimum/maximum timeframes for different plants
Add validation for realistic planting/harvesting dates
8. Additional Views
Harvest Calendar: Show when crops will be ready
Maintenance Schedule: Watering, fertilizing reminders
Garden Statistics: Space utilization, crop diversity metrics
Would you like me to help you implement any of these improvements by updating the specification document, or would you prefer to discuss any specific aspects in more detail?

Yes, please suggest improvements one-by-one and if I say "apply", make the modification to the file.
