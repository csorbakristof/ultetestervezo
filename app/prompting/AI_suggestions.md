# Initial preparation

## Improving the specification

Hello! I want to create an application. Its specification is in the @specification.md file. Please have a look at that file and suggest me improvements to the specification.

---

Yes, please suggest improvements one-by-one and if I say "apply", make the modification to the file.

--------

We are in a git repository. Add a ".gitignore" file so that only that is version controled what is really needed. For example installed node modules should not be.

# Starting the implementation

## Fixing Garden View drag'n'drop

I am testing the application in the garden view. In the bottom there are available plants and the text above it says I have to dran'n'drop it on the grid. But I cannot drag them... they seem to be only static images and text... please fix it.

--------

It works, thanks. Now please update @specification.md to contain this requirement, too.

## Plant Library

Now I am testing the Plant Library page. I can properly see the already available plants. If I want to add a new plant, its data are filled with some random values and I cannot edit them. Please make the plant data editable.

-----------------

I am testing the Plant Library. If I edit a plant, I cannot scroll down so I do not see all the editable fields and I cannot press the save or cancel buttons.

(I did not ask explicitly for a fix but AI did it.)
-------------

OK, now the buttons are really visible. The editor is a bit too narrow. It is unconvenient to use horizontal scroll and in the dropdown lists, "2 - Medium" does not fit into the visible are either. Make it wider, we should have enough space for the editor, that has priority.

------------------

The editor does not save the changes even if I press the "Save" button. Everything remaing at the original value.

(Error cause: plant name was used as ID and if changed, it could not find it to modify...)
---------------------

Cool, thanks. Now we have added the plant editing function. Please update the @prompting/specification.md to reflect these requirements.

## GardenView

Now lets turn to the Garden View. Allow me to set the size of the grid. I mean the vertical and horizontal number of cells.

--------------------

Now the specification requires bed and slot definitions. Both are rectangular areas. Please have a look at @specification.md for this. I need to draw beds and slots and set their names in the Garden View.

------------------

I also need functions to delete a bed or slot.

---------------------

Good. Now I need to be able to edit the name of a bed. And it is enough to show the name of the bed only in its upper left corner.

(2 feladat egyszerre.)

-------------------

"Bed and Slot Management" take too much space, position and size info is not needed. And put this section below the visualization map of the garden because lots of beds shift the map out of the screen.

------------------

Please move the "Available Plants - Drag to Garden" section just below the map.

-------------------

If the bed management part is out of the screen, I cannot scroll to it...

--------------------

Now please update @specification.md to reflect the changes we made.

## Editor checkbox

Good. Now I want to have a checkbox in the Garden View which can hide all grid, bed and slot editing functions if unchecked. The title of the checkbox should be "Editor". If unchecked, I only want to see the map and the available plants.

-----------------

Currently, the map shows all sides of the cells inside the beds with bold lines. Modify the visualization so that only the boundaries of beds and slots have bold lines.

--------------------

Some sides of the beds are not bold. The beds which do not touch the bottom of the grid do not have bold lines in their bottom. And the bed in the bottom-left corner does not have a bold right side.

----------------

Your condition for the lower and right border is not working. It is still not bold.

--------------------

The bed in the upper-left corner does not touch the right or lower boundary of the grid as the bed is smaller. But it still does not show the beds right and lower boundary with bold. And if I draw a bed in the middle of the grid (not touching any sides of the grid), the lower bed boundary is still missing.

----------------------

In @GardenView.tsx line 401 there is an "else if" which means that if "if (slotInfo)" is true, "bed" is not taken into account in the cell border style logic. The boundary should be bold if it is either the boundary of a bed or the boundary of a slot.

### Debug function needed

Add a "Debug" checkbox beside the "Editor" checkbox. If "Debug" is checked, show the bed name and slot ID in every cell of the map.

----

Sorry, I meant to show the number of the slots, not their ID.

----------

If we are in Debug mode (Debug checkbox is checked), in the "Bed and Slot Management", show the position and size of the beds and slots as well. But only if Debug is checked.

-----------

If I draw a bed with top-left corner in position (1,1) and a slot inside it with upper-left position (1,1), then the slot is put into position (2,2). Store the position of the slots with absolute grid coordinates, not relative to the bed they are assigned to.

--------------

If I draw a slot into "Bed 2", it gets the number 1, although there is already a slot with number 1 in "Bed 1". Why did the new slot get the number 1 and not number 3?

(Did not answer the question but modified the code accordingly. In this case, I have to explicitly ask AI to just answer the question and not modify anything.)

-----------------

Update the @specification.md to reflect the new changes we made. Do not include the global slot numbering because I have rolled back that change.

## Fill slots with the same plant

Modify the drag'n'drop logic of plants so that if I drop a plant on a slot, all cells of the same slot get that plant. If I drop a plant on a cell without a slot, just that cell should get the plant.

(AI noticed that deleting a plant should work in the same way!)
---------------------

From now if I start a prompt with "Q:", just answer my question and do not modify anything in the code.

-----------------

Q: if I drop a plant on a cell, does the data structure store which week I am modifying? The slots may have different plants in different time intervals, according to @specification.md .

------------

Now please modify the code as suggested by yourself to handle the temporal aspects of planting. If I drop a plant on a slot, you should assume that the current week is the week of planting and the slot should contain that plant until the end of the harvesting period of that plant.

-----------------

Add a control to Garden View to move the current week forward or backward. Update the map according to the new current week.

------------------

Please update @specification.md to reflect the changes we made.

## Timeline View

Now lets turn to the Timeline View. It should match the @specification.md .

-----

Modify the Timeline View to a transposed grid: rows should be the weeks and columns should be the slots.

-----

Update @specification.md to match the new changes.

## Persistency

Beside the 3 pages of the application, add a new one called "Storage". Add functions to it from the @specification.md section "Save and Load Operations".

----

Q: If I import a complete garden configuration, does it overwrite all previous data?

# Create user guide

I have created a @userguide.md file. Can you create a complete user guide for the application into this file?

# Create plant database

The application can import plant library from JSON. Please create that JSON file for me using external sources. It should have the format mentioned in @specification.md and use hungarian names for the plants.
Add the 20 most common plants grown in Hungary.

-----

Q: The import function of the application seems to expect the plant database in CVS format but I use JSON format. Does the implementation expect CSV format?

----

Modify the import function to handle plant-only JSON.

----

Please update @specification.md and @userguide.md to reflect the changes.

----

In the Storage page, add a button to clear all slot-plant assignments, so that the garden gets completely clean.

----

Please also update  @userguide.md to reflect the changes.

# Improve source code

Now we seem to be done for the first round. Please have a look at the source code and suggest refactoring, improvements. For example too long source code files should be divided into multiple ones to increase readability.

--------------

Q: Did you manage to restore all previous functionalities after the refactor?

(Now AI really checks functionalities in details!)

# Further steps...

Have a look at @hungarian_plants_database.json please. The "plant family" field is in english everywhere. Please translate those values into hungarian.
