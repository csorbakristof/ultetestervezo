# Initial preparation

## Improving the specification

Hello! I want to create an application. Its specification is in the @specification.md file. Please have a look at that file and suggest me improvements to the specification.

---

Yes, please suggest improvements one-by-one and if I say "apply", make the modification to the file.

--------

We are in a git repository. Add a ".gitignore" file so that only that is version controled what is really needed. For example installed node modules should not be.

# Starting the implementation

## Fixing Garden View drag'n'drop

I am testing the application in the garden view. In the bottom there are available plants and the text above it says I have to dran'n'drop it on the grid. But I cannot drag them... they seem to be only static images and text... please fix it.

--------

It works, thanks. Now please update @specification.md to contain this requirement, too.

## Plant Library

Now I am testing the Plant Library page. I can properly see the already available plants. If I want to add a new plant, its data are filled with some random values and I cannot edit them. Please make the plant data editable.

-----------------

I am testing the Plant Library. If I edit a plant, I cannot scroll down so I do not see all the editable fields and I cannot press the save or cancel buttons.

(I did not ask explicitly for a fix but AI did it.)
-------------

OK, now the buttons are really visible. The editor is a bit too narrow. It is unconvenient to use horizontal scroll and in the dropdown lists, "2 - Medium" does not fit into the visible are either. Make it wider, we should have enough space for the editor, that has priority.

------------------

The editor does not save the changes even if I press the "Save" button. Everything remaing at the original value.

(Error cause: plant name was used as ID and if changed, it could not find it to modify...)
---------------------

Cool, thanks. Now we have added the plant editing function. Please update the @prompting/specification.md to reflect these requirements.

## GardenView

Now lets turn to the Garden View. Allow me to set the size of the grid. I mean the vertical and horizontal number of cells.

--------------------

Now the specification requires bed and slot definitions. Both are rectangular areas. Please have a look at @specification.md for this. I need to draw beds and slots and set their names in the Garden View.

------------------

I also need functions to delete a bed or slot.

---------------------

Good. Now I need to be able to edit the name of a bed. And it is enough to show the name of the bed only in its upper left corner.

(2 feladat egyszerre.)

-------------------

"Bed and Slot Management" take too much space, position and size info is not needed. And put this section below the visualization map of the garden because lots of beds shift the map out of the screen.

------------------

Please move the "Available Plants - Drag to Garden" section just below the map.

-------------------

If the bed management part is out of the screen, I cannot scroll to it...

--------------------

Now please update @specification.md to reflect the changes we made.
