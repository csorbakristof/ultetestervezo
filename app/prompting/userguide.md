## Tips and Best Practices

### Garden Planning
1. **Start with Beds**: Create logical bed divisions before adding slots
2. **Use Meaningful Names**: Name beds by location or purpose (e.g., "Sunny Border", "Herb Garden")
3. **Plan Slot Sizes**: Consider mature plant size when creating slots
4. **Check Growth Duration**: Verify plant growth periods before planting

### Temporal Planning
1. **Succession Planting**: Use Timeline View to plan multiple harvests
2. **Crop Rotation**: Plan different plant families in rotation
3. **Seasonal Awareness**: Consider your local growing season
4. **Companion Planting**: Use plant compatibility information

### Data Management
1. **Regular Backups**: Export your garden setup regularly
2. **Version Control**: Use descriptive filenames with dates
3. **Share Libraries**: Export plant databases to share with others
4. **Import Gradually**: Test imports with copies of your data first
5. **Garden Maintenance**: Use Clear All Plant Assignments for fresh starts while preserving garden structure

### Interface Usage
1. **Editor Mode**: Turn off for clean presentation views
2. **Debug Mode**: Use for troubleshooting slot positions
3. **Week Navigation**: Use direct input for quick jumps to specific weeks
4. **Timeline Overview**: Use for annual planning and conflict detection

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Cannot plant here - overlaps with existing planting period"
- **Cause**: Trying to plant in a slot that already has an active planting
- **Solution**: Choose a different week or remove existing planting first
- **Check**: Use Timeline View to see all existing plantings

#### Plants not visible in Garden View
- **Cause**: Current week is outside the plant's growing period
- **Solution**: Navigate to a week within the plant's growth period
- **Check**: Verify the planting start and end weeks

#### Cannot see all editing controls
- **Cause**: Editor mode is disabled
- **Solution**: Check the "Editor" checkbox in Garden View
- **Alternative**: Some controls may be scrolled out of view

#### Accidentally cleared all plantings
- **Cause**: Used "Clear All Plant Assignments" function
- **Solution**: Restore from exported garden backup if available
- **Prevention**: Always export garden setup before using maintenance functions
- **Note**: Garden structure (beds, slots, plant library) remains intact

#### Import fails with "Invalid garden setup format"
- **Cause**: JSON data has incorrect structure for complete garden import
- **Solution**: For complete garden setup, ensure JSON has both "garden" and "plants" properties
- **Alternative**: Use plant-only JSON format with just "plants" array for library import
- **Check**: Validate JSON format using online JSON validators
- **Note**: System automatically detects and handles both complete and plant-only JSON formats

#### Bed/slot boundaries not showing correctly
- **Cause**: Drawing outside valid grid area or overlapping existing areas
- **Solution**: Ensure drawing stays within grid bounds and doesn't overlap
- **Check**: Use Debug mode to see exact positions

### Performance Tips
1. **Large Gardens**: Use reasonable grid sizes for better performance
2. **Many Plants**: Consider organizing plant library with good naming
3. **Timeline Scrolling**: Use keyboard navigation for faster timeline browsing
4. **Data Size**: Large plant libraries may slow CSV operations

### Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers with JavaScript enabled
- File download/upload capabilities required for Storage features
- Local storage for temporary data retention
